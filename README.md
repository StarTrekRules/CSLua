# CSLua
A Lua Interpreter in C#

This is a lua interpreter written in pure C# at about 600 lines of code.

Basic HTTP server implemented!
`listen(PATH, CALLBACK)`
Whatever the callback returns will be sent as the response

It is however very basic and does not have the following things implemented yet:
# Strings
# Tables
# MetaTables
# Stability and Readable errors
# Most standard functions such as require
